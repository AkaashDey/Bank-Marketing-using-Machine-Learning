# Bank-Marketing-using-Machine-Learning

This study resulted in the development of a machine learning model capable of predicting how likely people are to subscribe to a bank term deposit. The most effective model was a gradient boosting classifier with optimised hyperparameters. The model's performance is 79.5%.

A precision of 0.82 divided by a prevalence of 0.50 is 1.6, which indicates that the machine learning model performs 1.6 times better than random guessing. The concept proved successful in attracting 62% of clients who intend to commit to a term deposit.

We should target customers with high consumer price index and 3-month indication for loan repayment as they are high-importance elements for the model selction with important positive features and the business clients we should sell to, thus saving time and money and target those partiular clients which will result in increased revenue and growth
